Tkinter is commonly bundled with Python, using Tk and is Python's standard GUI framework. It is popular for its simplicity and graphical user interface. It is open source and available under the Python License. One of the advantages of choosing Tkinter is that since it comes by default, there is an abundance of resources, both codes and reference books. Also with the community being old and active, there are many users who can help you out in case of doubts. Here are some examples to get you started.

```python
